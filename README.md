# Frog: A 3D Ray Tracing Library for Rust #

I am writing this program purely for my education. However, I encourage
you to experiment and improve upon the code I have written.

Under lib.rs there are tests for every function in the library. Some of them,
such as draw_sphere_shaded(), show how the various parts of the library can
be stitched together to render images.
